    <h1>Mean Household Economics of Malaysia</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtext">
        Household economics in Malaysia reflects the financial well-being and living standards 
        of families across different regions. Over the past few decades, Malaysia has achieved steady 
        income growth and poverty reduction through 
        <span class="highlight">industrialisation</span>, 
        <span class="highlight">urban expansion</span>, and 
        <span class="highlight">improved education access</span>.

        <p>
            Malaysia's socioeconomic landscape shows <span class="highlight">clear regional divides</span> where
            Kuala Lumpur and Selangor continue to dominate due to <span class="highlight">urban concentration, diversified industries and advanced infrastructure</span>, driving higher incomes.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, <span class = "highlight">Sabah and Sarawak</span>,
            shows slower income growth due to <span class="highlight">geographical isolation and infrastructure gaps</span>, leaving them reliant on primary
            industries like oil, gas and timber. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, <span class="highlight">Johor</span> and <span class="highlight">Melaka</span> 
            benefit from <span class="highlight">industrial and cross-border trade with Singapore</span>. 
            In contrast, <span class="highlight">northern states</span> such as Kedah and Perlis 
            maintain moderate income levels, reflecting their dependence on agriculture and smaller urban economies.

            <p>Malaysia's income and poverty patterns reflect three key turning points:</p>

                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2007–2014:</span> <strong>Steady</strong> income growth and falling <strong>poverty rates</strong> marked post-industrial growth.</li>
                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2016:</span> <strong>Poverty rate spiked</strong> due to introduction of <strong>GST and inflation pressures</strong>.</li>
                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2020–2022:</span> Both income dropped and poverty rose, highlighting <strong>COVID-19's</strong> direct economic impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, <strong>high income</strong> usually aligns with <strong>lower poverty</strong>, but GST and COVID-19 disrupts this pattern and widen disparities.</p>

        <h4 class="context-header">Household Spending Patterns</h4>
        <p>Malaysia's household spending patterns reveal persistent regional and structural disparities. While overall expenditure levels remained
            steady up to 2019, <span class = "explanation-highlight">decline</span> in 2022 suggests households adjusted their spending habits due to <span class = "explanation-highlight">pandemic-driven income disruptions</span>.
        </p>

        <p>Urbanised regions, particularly <span class = "explanation-highlight">Central Region</span>, sustain higher expenditure levels, reflecting their
        <span class = "explanation-highlight">strong purchasing power and higher living costs</span>. Meanwhile, spending in <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Malaysia and East Coast</span> remain modest, underscoring the continued urban-rural divide in economic and purchasing power.</p>
    
        <p>Acorss categories, most spendings concentrate on essential needs such as <span class = "explanation-highlight">housing, food and utilities</span>, highlighting limited flexibility for discretionary expenses. This suggests that many households still remain sensititve to

        <p>The visuals highlight persistent regional disparities in Malayisa's income distribution.

        <p>Meanwhile, <span class = "explanation-highlight">household numbers</span> have steadily increased nationwide, particularly in <span class = "explanation-highlight">industrialised states like Kuala Lumpur and Selangor</span>, indicating <span class = "explanation-highlight">continued urban migration and economic centralisation</span>.
