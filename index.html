    <h1>Mean Household Economics of Malaysia</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtext">
        Household economics in Malaysia reflects the financial well-being and living standards 
        of families across different regions. Over the past few decades, Malaysia has achieved steady 
        income growth and poverty reduction through 
        <span class="highlight">industrialisation</span>, 
        <span class="highlight">urban expansion</span>, and 
        <span class="highlight">improved education access</span>.

        <h4 class="context-header">Economic Disparities Across Malaysia</h4>
        <p>
            The map reveals Malaysia's persistent regional economic imbalance driven by <span class="highlight">structural and regional factors</span>. High-income states in the central region, particularly
            Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, continnue to dominate due to <span class="highlight">urban concentration, diversified industries and advanced infrastructure</span>, which attract invesment and skill labours.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, <span class="highlight">East Malaysia</span>, especially Sabah and Sarawak,
            shows slower income growth due to <span class="highlight">geographical isolation and infrastructure gaps</span>, leaving them reliant on primary
            industries like oil, gas and timber. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, states like <span class="highlight">Johor</span> and <span class="highlight">Melaka</span> 
            have shown steady progress, benefiting from <span class="highlight">cross-border trade with Singapore</span> where industrial zones expanded, toursim and port activities are also grown. 
            In constrast, <span class="highlight">northern states</span> such as Kedah and Perlis 
            maintain moderate income levels, reflecting their dependence on agriculture and smaller urban economies.

            <p>Malaysia's income and poverty patterns reflect three key turning points:</p>
            <ul class="indicator-list">
                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2007–2014:</span> <strong>Steady</strong> income growth and falling <strong>poverty rates</strong> marked post-industrial growth.</li>
                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2016:</span> <strong>Poverty rate spiked</strong> due to introduction of <strong>GST and inflation pressures</strong>.</li>
                <li><span class="explanation-highlight">2020–2022:</span> Both income dropped and poverty rose, highlighting <strong>COVID-19's</strong> direct economic impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, <strong>high income</strong> usually aligns with <strong>lower poverty</strong>, but GST and COVID-19 disrupts this pattern and widen disparities.</p>

        <h4 class="context-header">Household Spending Patterns</h4>
        <p>Malaysia's overall household spending remained relatively stable between <span class = "explanation-highlight"> 2016 to 2019</span>, then experiencing slight decline in <span class = "explanation-highlight">2022</span>,
            reflecting impact of <span class = "explanation-highlight">COVID-19</span> pandemic on Malaysia's economy.</p>
        <p>The <span class = "explanation-highlight">Central Region</span> recorded the highest mean expenditure, supported by higher living costs and income levels in urbanised states like <span class = "explanation-highlight">Kuala Lumpur</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">Selangor</span>.</p>
        <p>In contrast, <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Malaysia</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Coast</span> regions like Kelantan and Terengganu showed lovwer average expenditure, aligning with their generally lower income levels and more rural composition.</p>
        <p>In terms of <span class = "explanation-highlight">expenditure categories</span>, <span class = "explanation-highlight">Housing & Utilities</span> contributed to the largest share of spending, followed by <span class = "explanation-highlight">Restaurants & Accomodations, Food & Beverages</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">Transport</span>.
        This indicates that hosuehold budgets are mainly dominated by essential spending while expenditures on <span class = "explanation-highlight">Recreation & Culture</span>, <span class = "explanation-highlight">Clothing & Footwear</span> and other non essentials remain comparatively smaller.</p>
        <p>Overall, this reflects how Malaysian households prioritize necessities despite <span class = "explanation-highlight">ongoing cost-of-living pressure</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">the gradual economic recovery</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="context-header">Insights on Household & Income Inequality</h4>
        <p>The scatterplot illustrates the relationship between <span class = "explanation-highlight">mean household income</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">income inequality (Gini coefficient)</span>, revealing persistent disparities among Malaysian states. In earlier years like <span class = "explanation-highlight">2007</span>, states such as <span class = "explanation-highlight">Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Pulau Pinang</span> recorded higher mean household incomes yet their 
        Gini coefficients remain relatively similar to other states. This indicates that income growth in these urbanised regions was <span class = "explanation-highlight">not evenly distributed</span>, with wealth concentrated among higher income groups.</p>
        <p>In contrast, <span class = "explanation-highlight">poorer states</span> like <span class = "explanation-highlight">Kelantan, Perlis and Sabah</span> displayed lower mean incomes alongside moderare inequality, reflecting limited economic diversification and slower development progress.</p>
        <p>The heatmap further demonstrates <span class = "explanation-highlight">a steady rise in the number of households</span> from <span class = "explanation-highlight">2010 to 2024</span>, particularly in <span class = "explanation-highlight">urbanised and industrial states</span> like <span class = "explanation-highlight">Selangor, Johor and Kuala Lumpur</span>, likley driven by migration and better employment opportunities. Meanwhile, <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Malaysian states</span> like Sabah and Sarawak
        exhibits <span class = "explanation-highlight">slower household growth</span>, consistent with their dependence on <span class = "explanation-highlight">primary industries and limited infrastructure</span>.</p>
        <p>Viewed together, both these visuals emphasise that while Malaysia has achieved <span class = "explanation-highlight">nationwide household growth, regional income inequality persists</span>, with <span class = "explanation-highlight">urban prosperity</span> coexisting alongside rural economic lag.</p>
