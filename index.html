    <h1>Mean Household Economics of Malaysia</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtext">
        Household economics in Malaysia reflects the financial well-being and living standards 
        of families across different regions. Over the past few decades, Malaysia has achieved steady 
        income growth and poverty reduction through 
        <span class="highlight">industrialisation</span>, 
        <span class="highlight">urban expansion</span>, and 
        <span class="highlight">improved education access</span>.

        <em>Behind Malaysia’s steady rise in income lies a diverse story — where some states thrive while others face persistent inequality.</em>

        <h4 class="context-header">Economic Disparities Across Malaysia</h4>
        <p>
            The 2022 data highlights Malaysia’s persistent economic divide between urbanized and rural regions. 
            Western Peninsular Malaysia, particularly <span class="highlight">Kuala Lumpur</span>, 
            <span class="highlight">Selangor</span>, and <span class="highlight">Penang</span>, 
            continues to lead with higher mean household incomes. 
            This prosperity stems from established industrial sectors, service hubs, and robust infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, <span class="highlight">East Malaysia</span>, especially Sabah and Sarawak,
            shows slower income growth due to logistical challenges, limited industrial activity and dependency on 
            primary industries such as <span class="highlight">palm oil, timber, and petroleum</span>. Although poverty rates have declined nationally, a significant economic inequality gap still exists in these states.
        </p>

        <p>
            States like <span class="highlight">Johor</span> and <span class="highlight">Melaka</span> 
            have shown steady progress, benefiting from cross-border trade and manufacturing expansion. 
            Meanwhile, <span class="highlight">northern states</span> such as Kedah and Perlis 
            maintain moderate income levels with slower economic advancement.

        <p>The <span class = "explanation-highlight">Central Region</span> recorded the highest mean expenditure, supported by higher living costs and income levels in urbanised states like <span class = "explanation-highlight">Kuala Lumpur</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">Selangor</span>.</p>
        <p>In contrast, <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Malaysia</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">East Coast</span> regions like Kelantan and Terengganu showed lovwer average expenditure, aligning with their generally lower income levels and more rural composition.</p>
        <p>In terms of <span class = "explanation-highlight">expenditure categories</span>, <span class = "explanation-highlight">Housing & Utilities</span> contributed to the largest share of spending, followed by <span class = "explanation-highlight">Restaurants & Accomodations, Food & Beverages</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">Transport</span>.
        This indicates that hosuehold budgets are mainly dominated by essential spending while expenditures on <span class = "explanation-highlight">Recreation & Culture</span>, <span class = "explanation-highlight">Clothing & Footwear</span> and other non essentials remain comparatively smaller.</p>
        <p>Overall, this reflects how Malaysian households prioritize necessities despite <span class = "explanation-highlight">ongoing cost-of-living pressure</span> and <span class = "explanation-highlight">the gradual economic recovery</span>.</p>
